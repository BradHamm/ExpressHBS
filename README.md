## User Story

As a frequent desktop user I want an accessable dashbord which utilizes several different APIs, so that I can have easy-access to information on weather forecasts, NASDAQ graphs and news updates.

- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - [ ] Criteria 1: When I open the webpage, I am presented with a polished UI displaying information on this week's forecast, charts on the NASDAQ market and pre-saved bookmarks which I want seperate from my browser's toolbar.
  - [ ] Criteria 2: When I navigate away from the page and return at a later point in time, I want my preferences and information saved to local storage.
  - [ ] Criteria 3: When I add a new bookmark to the page, I want options for choosing an icon, folder organization and the name of the associated bookmark.
